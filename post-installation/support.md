# Support

Support are provided in the following ways:

* [Github issue tracker](https://github.com/osy86/HaC-Mini/issues)
* [InsanelyMac](https://www.insanelymac.com/forum/topic/339291-guide-hac-mini-osx-mojave-on-intel-hades-canyon-nuc8i7hvknuc8i7hnk/)
* [/r/Hackintosh Discord](http://discord.io/hackintosh)

Do **not** ask for help in tonymacx86 \(better yet, stop going to tonymacx86!\). They do not permit discussion of anything except for their own "approved" installation methods--which are all pretty problematic. We tried to provide help there in the past but was banned for linking to a non-tonymac approved guide.
